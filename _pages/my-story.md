# How It's Been

## Background

- I'm a master's student in Data Science at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, NY. Before SBU, I graduated from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India, where I earned a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communications Engineering with a Specialization in Data Science. (Too much Data Science, I know :))

- I'm passionate about full-stack development, statistics, machine learning, and cloud database systems. Over the years, I've completed several ML projects and also used my full-stack expertise to help a couple of startups. I developed a keen interest in NLP research during my first semester of my master's. Thus, I have started comprehending very interesting papers and topics. I'm enthusiastic to create AI intelligent systems that can enhance people's lives.

- During my undergrad, even though my degree was in Electronics & Communications, I was very much ignited by the concepts and theories I came across in my ML and Statistical Inference class.I also have a keen interest in mathematics since my childhood. I feel it's a comforting when I'm doing it.
 Since my childhood, I had a very strong interest in adapting to new gadgets and trying new applications. Thus, I came across ChatGPT (when it was not famous) and was sincerely mesmerized by how it was possible. I questioned myself: is this the new era? Later on, understanding it in a deeper sense, I was even more stunned when I got to the conclusion that AI systems were just playing with patterns. Whether it was solving a complex, world-saving problem or performing basic addition, it was doing the same thing: recognizing patterns and making a perfect prediction to minimize its loss. 

- Nowadays, in my spare time, I commit myself to personal growth, at times I take time building personal projects and if that was not happeing I grind mastering Data Structures or I try understanding and journaling new papers in both NLP and RL from esteemed researchers like Dr.Sergey Levine and Dr.Christopher Manning. and the otherway around When I feel that I need a relievement, I spend it by talking to my friends, going out, and if I'm locked in a room, then I'll be Netflixing or watching old cricket match highlights.

- In forthcoming future I also want to indulge in Research too. I am enthusiactic to be in forefront of discovering something awesome that may have a grreater Impact.

## MY JOURNEY

- During the first 13 years of my life, I was fully absorbed by cartoons, cricket, and maybe math too. I don't know, I had a habit of imagining fictional stories. Maybe I will pen down some novels in the future.

- At 15, I was sent to study in a bigger school, and as it was residential, everything changed. I became independent.

- I was depressed about my JEE results but got into SRM (a tier-2 private university), thanks to luck and Dad.

- And from that day, it's a marathon I am running, thanks to my pals who are with me.

- I personally love coding. I enjoy it; maybe it's gives the same dopamine hit when I play video games.

- I personally feel, after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the ending was Dr. Bowman becoming a star child, that everyone has a destiny to fulfill. As a whole(humanity), we are meant to be something bigger (maybe transform into a star child or becoming something so different which we can't even think of).

## I LIKE

- CRICKET (Left-handed batter and Right-Hand Fast-medium bowler)
- Bodybuilding
- Cars. One of my dreams is to own and customize one like this.

- Football-Manchester United (Go, Red Devils!)
- Docu-Series
- Movies (Tollywood & Hollywood)
- Sitcoms

## FUN FACTS

- A die-hard Vijay Devarakonda and Brad Pitt fan.
- I was inspired to be successful and be a "statistical analysis and data reconfiguration" mastered professional by my spirit animal, Chandler Bing from Friends (Kidding!).

## I DREAM OF

- Inspiring and feeling inspired.
- Treating every individual with genuine respect.
- Staying curious.
- Lifelong learning.
- Being self-absorbed until the end in a certain Research domain so that I can contribute something I can be proud of while I am Dying.
- And of course, smashing sixes like Abhishek Sharma, who is my current favorite.
