# How It's Been

## Background

- I'm a master's student in Data Science at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, NY. Before SBU, I graduated from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India, where I earned a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communications Engineering with a Specialization in Data Science. (Too much Data Science, I know :))

- I'm passionate about full-stack development, statistics, machine learning, and cloud database systems. Over the years, I've completed several ML projects and also used my full-stack expertise to help a couple of startups(my roomie's). I developed a keen interest in NLP research during my first semester of my master's. Thus, I have started comprehending very interesting papers and topics. I'm enthusiastic to create AI intelligent systems that can enhance people's lives.

- During my undergrad, even though my degree was in Electronics & Communications, I was very much ignited by the concepts and theories I came across in my ML and Statistical Inference class, thus I fixated myself to do masters in Data science. I also had a keen interest in mathematics since my childhood, It feels exiciting and comforting while I'm doing it.

- I've always been drawn to the cutting edge, a digital nomad constantly trying out the newest gadgets, installing and trying fresh and unique applications I can find online, and also learning interesting things about both the world and tech. I Remember, maybe when I am 12 or 13 I think, My trusty Nokia 6300, a humble buttoned companion, was my window into the tech world, where I'd pore over details about companies, their origins, and their groundbreaking creations.It was with that same insatiable curiosity that I stumbled upon ChatGPT (back when it wasn't famous) and was honestly mesmerized by how it was possible. I questioned myself: Is this the new era? Later, understanding it more deeply, I was even more stunned when I concluded that AI systems were just playing with patterns. Whether it was solving a complex, world-saving problem or performing basic calculations, it was doing the same thing: recognizing patterns and making a perfect prediction to minimize its loss.

- These days, my free time is all about personal growth. I'm often building my own projects, or if that's not happening, I'm deep into mastering Data Structures. I also spend a good chunk of time trying to wrap my head around and journal about new papers in NLP and Reinforcement Learning. Lately, I've really felt myself leaning towards the research work of big names like Dr. Sergey Levine and Dr. Christopher Manning. But when I need to chill out and get away from all that, I'm usually hanging with friends, heading out, or if I'm stuck inside, I'll just be binging Netflix or catching up on old cricket highlights.

- In forthcoming future, I also want to indulge in Research too. I am enthusiactic to be in forefront of discovering something awesome that may have a grreater Impact.

## MY JOURNEY

- During the first 13 years of my life, I was fully absorbed by cartoons, cricket, and maybe math too. I don't know, I had a habit of imagining great fictional stories. Maybe I will pen down some novels in the future.

- At 15, I was sent to study in a bigger school, and as it was residential, everything changed. I became independent.

- I was depressed about my JEE results but got into SRM (a tier-2 private university), thanks to luck and Dad.

- And from that day, it's a marathon I am running, thanks to my pals who are with me.

- I personally love coding. I enjoy it; maybe it's gives the same dopamine hit similar to when I play video games.

- I personally feel, after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the ending was Dr. Bowman becoming a star child, that everyone has a destiny to fulfill. As a whole(humanity), we are meant to be something bigger (maybe transform into a star child or becoming something so different which we can't even think of).

## I LIKE

- CRICKET (Left-handed batter and Right-Hand Fast-medium bowler)
- Bodybuilding
- Cars. One of my dreams is to own and customize one like this.

- Football-Manchester United (Go, Red Devils!)
- Docu-Series
- Movies (Tollywood & Hollywood)
- Sitcoms

## FUN FACTS

- As an Hardcore Telugu cinephile, I declare myself to be a die-hard Vijay Devarakonda and Brad Pitt Fan.
- I was inspired to be successful and be a "statistical analysis and data reconfiguration" mastered professional by my spirit animal, Chandler Bing from Friends (Kidding!).

## I DREAM OF

- Inspiring and feeling inspired.
- Treating every individual with genuine respect.
- Staying curious.
- Lifelong learning.
- Being self-absorbed in a certain Research domain so that I can contribute something that I can be proud of while Dying.
- And of course, smashing sixes like Abhishek Sharma, who is my current favorite.
